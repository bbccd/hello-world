# hello-world

Hello, fellow humans,

this is bBccd. I like Python (for its community, and the great tools it created - specifically in the data analysis realm, like Pandas or scikit-learn), and Swift (for its modern, type safe design, its multi-paradigm support - and also for its community). I am a recovering natural scientist who is in love with the great promises IT makes - and also a bit sceptical and wary of it. Trying to balance the two. Oh, and: I am a minimalist. Thus, I stop here.
